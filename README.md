# K-Nearest-Neighbor-From-Scratch
Just a brief fun little Function that runs KNN predictions with 3 potential types of distance (Manhattan, Euclidian and Chebyshev).

This project demonstrates my ability to manipulate Diciontaries, Arrays, Lists and callable functions to create custom models (KNN) from scratch, showing the math behind how the distance is calculated and how classification is determined on test sets.
